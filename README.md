# AFM 423: Topics in Financial Econometrics

The methods presented in this course are tailored to address specific issues of interest in finance, such as the quantification of the risk-return tradeoff, the modelling of time-varying stock/bond market volatility and, possibly, also the statistical analysis of financial derivatives such as options.
